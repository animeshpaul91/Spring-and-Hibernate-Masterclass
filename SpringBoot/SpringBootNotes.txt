1. Spring Boot helps package your entire application into a JAR file. 
2. This JAR file contains the Application code as well as an embedded application server container (Tomcat, Jetty etc). 
3. This also helps to run the application on the command line -> java - jar <jar file>
4. Packaging can also be in classical WAR format where in you can deploy your WAR file in an application server on your PC or your corporate network. 

** SpringBoot Applications already have an application server embedded in them **

Java Persistence API (JPA)

In SpringBoot, Hibernate is the default implementation of JPA. 
Entity Manager is similar to Hibernate Session Factory.
Entity Manager can serve as a wrapper for a Hibernate Session Object. 
We can inject Entity Manager into our DAO as the Entity Manager Bean is created by SpringBoot.
