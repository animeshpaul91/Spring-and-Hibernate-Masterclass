# Simple Task Tracker Web Application

<p> This project centered around building a simple task tracker Full-Stack Application. This is a basic CRUD application equipped with a front end design which allows a user to perform the following tasks: </p>

1. Create new tasks
2. Display existing tasks
3. Update existing tasks
4. Delete existing tasks

<p> All the above tasks are exposed by a REST API from a SpringBoot running backend application. A client application running in Angular consumes the REST API and provides a neat UI to the end user to perform the tasks. </p>


<p> An in-memory database (H2) is used in the application. The user is allowed to login as well as logout. For security and access control, JSON Web Token (JWT) is used. A REST endpoint which accepts the username is exposed and the client app makes an HTTP request to this endpoint to authenticate the user. <p>
