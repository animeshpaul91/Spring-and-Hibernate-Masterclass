Section - 2 Introduction to Web Services:

Web service - Software System designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network. Key points:
1. Designed for machine to machine or (application to application) interaction.
2. Should be interoperable - Not platform/technology dependent. 
3. Should allow communication over a network. 

Formats for Request and Response. These are also called Message Exchange Formats. 
1. XML
2. JSON

Key details are specified in service definition - Request/Response Format, Request Structure, Response Structure, Endpoints.

Mediums of Exposure/Transport - HTTP and MQ. Communication occurrs over queue.

Web Service Groups:
1. SOAP
* Only uses XML as the request exchange format.
* Poses restrictions on the format of the XML which is exchanged between service provider and consumer.
* Does not pose a restriction on the Transport. You can use HTTP as well as MQ.
* Defines specific XML request and response structure.
* The request structure contains Envelope, Header and body. 
* WSDL is used as Service Definition. 

2. REST
* Think in terms of Resources.
* Makes use of only HTTP.
* No specific data exchange format. JSON is popular.
* No standard service definition. WADL (Web Application Definition Language), Swagger exists.
